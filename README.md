# Simple Fighter

Simple Fighter is a turn-based fighting game written in C. 
There is not much to expect, except to choose two fighters and 5 different moves to fight. Block is randomly decided. 

It will be improved over time to become a turn-based fighting game which uses Street Fighter characters and moves.
